Welcome to my presentation resources page! This repository contains all the materials from my talk about the revolutionary changes SQLcl Project brings to Oracle APEX and Database deployments.

## How to Follow the Demos

Throughout the presentation, you'll encounter slides marked with demo indicators. To get the most out of these demos:

1. When you see a slide with a demo indicator (example below), note the demo number:
